Here’s a table of contents or topic overview for starting system design from scratch, aggregated from multiple trusted sources:

* * *

### **1\. System Design Basics**

*   **What is System Design?**
*   Key principles: Scalability, reliability, maintainability, and performance.
*   Understanding functional vs. non-functional requirements【9】【10】.

### **2\. Key Components of System Design**

*   Load balancers
*   Caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
*   Databases: SQL vs. NoSQL
*   Indexing and search engines
*   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
*   API design and gateways【9】【10】.

### **3\. Designing Large-Scale Systems**

*   High-level design: Defining components and their interactions.
*   Microservices vs. monoliths
*   Service-oriented architecture (SOA)
*   Distributed systems principles (e.g., CAP theorem, eventual consistency)【10】.

### **4\. Storage and Databases**

*   Database sharding and replication
*   Schema design: Choosing SQL or NoSQL
*   Database indexing and partitioning【9】【10】.

### **5\. Scalability and Performance Optimization**

*   Horizontal vs. vertical scaling
*   Caching strategies
*   Load testing and benchmarking
*   Back-of-the-envelope calculations for system loads【9】【10】.

### **6\. Networking Basics**

*   HTTP/HTTPS protocols
*   TCP/IP, UDP
*   RESTful APIs vs. RPC
*   Websockets for real-time communication【9】【10】.

### **7\. Security Considerations**

*   Authentication and authorization (OAuth, JWT, IAM)
*   Data encryption and hashing
*   Security at scale (e.g., rate limiting, DDoS protection)【9】【10】.

### **8\. Real-World System Design Examples**

*   URL shortener (e.g., Bit.ly)
*   Design a social network (e.g., Facebook, Twitter)
*   Web crawler
*   Real-time chat application (e.g., WhatsApp)
*   Video streaming platform (e.g., YouTube, Netflix)【9】【10】.

### **9\. Interview Preparation**

*   How to approach a system design interview question
*   Practicing with common interview questions (e.g., design Instagram, Twitter)
*   Mock interview setups【9】【10】.

* * *

If you’re starting from scratch, I suggest following a structured progression:

1.  Begin with **system design basics** and build a solid foundation.
2.  Move to **key components** and study one at a time.
3.  Solve simple design problems (e.g., URL shortener) before tackling complex systems.
